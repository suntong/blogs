# The "no-sugar" style
[category Tech][tags writing]

## Situation

I'm the person who like concise, and don't like the literature style stuffing in lots of irrelevant information to distract you from the main idea. So when I read a book called *"No bullshit Java"*, I know that's exactly the kind of writing style I prefer, both reading and writing. 

However, that *"No bullshit"* is kind of stronger than my tolerance. Is there a better phrase that can convey the idea that I don't like those "bullshit", but not as strong? 

Example usage:

> I read a very useful blog, but there are so many distraction there that it is very easy to miss a step. So I'm documenting it again in my (no-)____ style. 

I want something more vivid than "concise" (or "distilled"), but not as colorful as "no bullshit".

## Consideration

For the situation like above, [most people would think](http://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/82118) that "*no nonsense*" is the best phrase to describe it. However, I'm still hesitate to use it for the above blog-rewriting case, because if I use it, it'd imply the other blogger has lots of "*nonsense*" in his/her blog. That's not what I really meant. Many people like to expose their "life long" stories before they start talking business. That's their style. Although I really don't like that, I wouldn't call them "*nonsense*" for *their* blogs (but will do for mine).

## My Choice

Now, what's my final choice?

First, let me precisely define what I'm trying to do (or describe) -- I want to leave out any *frivolous* distraction from my writing. The [number one meaning of frivolous from OED](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/frivolous) is "*not having any serious purpose or value*". Those are the things I want to eliminate, so that my writing can be *succinct*, meaning "briefly and clearly expressed, especially of something written or spoken" [from OED](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/succinct).

- If I'm purely talking about my writing, I will surely to use "*no nonsense*" to describe it.
- However, if I'm talking about condensing another article, which has many frivolous distractions, into succinct writing, I'll call it ***"no-sugar"*** style rewrite, because there is another person involved.

The phrase *"no-sugar"* has a computer technical meaning of no-frivolous these days [among a small population](http://ell.stackexchange.com/a/82120/5857). Although it is still not widely heard/known, I hope it can get accepted by a broader audience. Thus I'm promoting the phrase now, because this the least condescending and most neutral way to describe it. Just like the coffee, no-sugar means just the coffee, nothing else! I like the expression.
